Information Retrieval

### Index files
  create an Index file ( use *create_index.py*)
  
  The created index file will be used to create the rest.
  we will be using the pickle file to create:
  ###### reversed index file
  ###### weighted reversed index file
  Using the script *create_pkls.py*
  
### Boolean Model
  Evaluate boolean expressions and return relevant documents
 
### Vectorial Model
  We used four (4) methods:
  inner product, Dice, Cosinus, Jaccard
    *(equations should be taken with a grain of salt)*
  
### Evaluation of the vectorial model
  Uses a collection of relevant documents to evaluate the vectorial model
  returns recall and precition values

### Similarity study
  shows how much the recall and precision change by changing the length of returned documents by the system.
  or shows how much the recall and precision change by changing the weight threshold for the returned documents.

The app was created using QT.
QT designer for the interface.




##### NOTE: 
    this project was mostly written using english terms.
      you may find some french terms like:
        produit interne = inner product
        rappel = recall
        lecture = reading 
        Afficher = to display
        traitement = processing
      The main interface is in french.

This project was created with my partner at the university
